### Tasks

The project is still under development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- [x] Generating the Data Sets used for analysis
- [ ] Improving theoretical understanding on False Nearest Neighbors through the paper "Local false nearest neighbors and dynamical dimensions from observed chaotic data", 1993, Abarbanel & Kennel
- [ ] Reproducing the results obtained in the main paper
