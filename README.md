## üìë Brief description of files:
  
  Here are brief descriptions of the main files/folders used in this project:

* fnn_KennelFraction_Write.m (saves the values of the Kennel Fraction of FNN in text files);
* fnn_KennelFraction_Read.m (reads text files with the values of the Kennel Fraction of FNN);
* fnn_KennelFraction_Plot.m (plots the values of the Kennel Fraction of FNN by the value of the embedded dimension);

Note: files from the "data" folder can be used so that it is not necessary to run the program fnn_KennelFraction_Write.m.

* datasets.m (generates the sets to be analyzed);
* lorenz.m and duffing.m (numerically solve the two systems of differential equations);
* data (contains the data generated by fnn_KennelFraction_Write.m)
